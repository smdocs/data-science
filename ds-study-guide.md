### Probability And Statistics
A common question you might get at FAANG companies and other tech companies alike is the occasional probability or statistics question. The questions won’t necessarily require complex math. However, if you haven’t thought about independent and dependent probabilities in while. It is good to review setting up the basic formulas.

### Probability Interview Questions

Most of these questions are either similar to the ones we have been asked or taken directly from glassdoor.com.

1. A die is rolled twice. What is the probability of showing a 3 on the first roll and an odd number on the second roll?
2. In any 15-minute interval, there is a 20% probability that you will see at least one shooting star. What is the proba­bility that you see at least one shooting star in the period of an hour?
3. Alice has 2 kids and one of them is a girl. What is the probability that the other child is also a girl? You can assume that there are an equal number of males and females in the world.
4. You’re about to get on a plane to Seattle. You want to know
5. How many ways can you split 12 people into 3 teams of 4?

### Statistics Concepts
Statistics is a broad concept so don’t get too bogged down in the details of each of these videos. Instead, just make sure you can explain each of these concepts at the surface level.

1. Bias Variance Trade Off
2. Confusion Matrix
3. ROC curve
4. Normal Distribution
5. P-Value
6. Pearson Spearman
